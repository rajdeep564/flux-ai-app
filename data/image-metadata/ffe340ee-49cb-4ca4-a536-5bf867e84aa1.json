  "prompt": "[SCENE START] A full-body, hyper-realistic cinematic still. The setting is a primordial African jungle, moments after a downpour; the air is thick with humidity and mist. Our hero, TOM CRUISE (age 58, rugged, intensely focused), is seated atop a colossal male lion. His weight is convincingly settled, his legs tensed. He wears practical, dirt-stained cargo pants and a dark, sweat-soaked henley shirt. One hand is firmly entwined in the lion's dense, rain-dampened mane. The LION is a magnificent, prime specimen, its muscles rippling with each powerful step on the damp, mossy ground. Its golden eyes are sharp, looking forward. LIGHTING: The scene is backlit by the setting sun breaking through clouds, creating a dramatic rim light around Tom and the lion, separating them from the dark, out-of-focus jungle background. Strong god-rays pierce the canopy. CAMERA: Captured with an 85mm lens at a low angle to emphasize power and scale. The image quality is pristine, 8K resolution, capturing every detail: the texture of Tom's skin, the individual strands of wet fur, the droplets of water on leaves. COLOR GRADE: A sophisticated teal and orange palette; highlights are warm and golden, while shadows are a cool, deep teal, creating a modern, epic feel. [SCENE END]\"",
