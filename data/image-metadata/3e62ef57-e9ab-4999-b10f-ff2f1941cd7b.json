  "prompt": "The \"Golden Hour Serenity\" Prompt\nCreate a photorealistic and intimate portrait of two people standing at a scenic viewpoint overlooking the lush, rolling hills and misty valleys of a serene mountain landscape, like the Western Ghats, during the soft glow of the golden hour.\n\nSubject 1 (The Anchor):\n\nIdentity: Use the provided image  as the absolute, non-negotiable anchor for this person's identity. Their facial structure, features, and exact likeness must be replicated with 1:1 photorealistic accuracy. This is the most critical instruction.\n\nAttire: Dress this person in comfortable yet stylish, high-quality natural fabrics. A soft, earth-toned linen shirt and dark, well-fitted trousers would be appropriate for the setting.\n\nSubject 2 (The Addition):\n\nIdentity: Next to Subject 1, place an Indian woman with a warm, gentle, and authentic expression.\n\nAttire: Her clothing should be elegant and natural. Style her in a beautiful, hand-woven cotton saree or a simple linen dress in a solid, muted color like ochre, rust, or deep indigo. The look should feel modern yet classic, and completely at home in the natural environment.\n\nScene & Lighting (Unified for Both Subjects):\n\nLighting: The entire scene must be bathed in the warm, diffused, low-angled light of the setting sun. This golden hour light should create soft, long shadows and a gentle, warm glow on their faces and hair, highlighting skin textures naturally.\n\nAtmosphere: The air should have a hint of mist rising from the valleys below. The background should be a beautifully soft, out-of-focus vista of green hills under a warm sky.\n\nMood: The two subjects should share a moment of quiet, candid companionship. Their interaction should feel unposed and genuineâ€”perhaps they are looking out at the vista together or sharing a soft, subtle smile.\n\nThe final image must have the quality of a professional portrait shot on a high-end camera with a prime lens, resulting in a beautiful, natural bokeh that makes the subjects stand out.\n\nCrucial Constraints to Follow:\n\nThe face of Subject 1 must remain identical to the source image [img1].\n\nAvoid any artificial, harsh, or studio lighting. The lighting must be entirely natural.\n\nThe interaction must feel authentic, not staged or posed.\n\nEnsure the final image is rich in natural detail and texture, from the fabric of their clothes to the realism of the surrounding landscape.",
