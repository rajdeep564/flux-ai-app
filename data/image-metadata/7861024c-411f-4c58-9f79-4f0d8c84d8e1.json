  "prompt": "Create a highly realistic photograph of a young man drinking water from a modern navy-blue water bottle with a looped cap (as seen in the attached bottle image). The man should be based exactly on the attached portrait — his face structure, expression, and natural look must be preserved without change. He is dressed in a black shirt and is mid-action, gently tilting the bottle toward his mouth while looking naturally engaged in drinking. The background is outdoors in a lush green park setting, matching the original environment from the portrait image. The lighting should be soft and natural, with daylight filtering through trees. The final image must appear candid, sharp, and authentic — like a moment captured on a phone or DSLR, with no signs of being artificial or digitally altered.",
